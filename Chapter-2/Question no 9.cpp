/*If you have two fractions, a/b and c/d, their sum can be obtained from the formula
Write a program that encourages the user to enter two fractions, and then displays their
sum in fractional form. (You donâ€™t need to reduce it to lowest terms.) The interaction
with the user might look like this:
Enter first fraction: 1/2
Enter second fraction: 2/5
Sum = 9/10
You can take advantage of the fact that the extraction operator ( >> ) can be chained to
read in more than one quantity at once:
cin >> a >> dummychar >> b;*/

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	int a,b,c,d;
	char x;
	cout<<"enter first fraction :";
	cin>>a>>x>>b;
	cout<<"enter second fraction :";
	cin>>c>>x>>d;
	int y=a*d+b*c;
	int z=b*d;
	cout<<"sum="<<y<<"/"<<z;
	return 0;
