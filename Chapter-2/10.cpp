/*In the heyday of the British empire, Great Britain used a monetary system based on
pounds, shillings, and pence. There were 20 shillings to a pound, and 12 pence to a
shilling. The notation for this old system used the pound sign, £, and two decimal points,
so that, for example, £5.2.8 meant 5 pounds, 2 shillings, and 8 pence. (Pence is the plural
of penny.) The new monetary system, introduced in the 1950s, consists of only pounds
and pence, with 100 pence to a pound (like U.S. dollars and cents). We’ll call this new
system decimal pounds. Thus £5.2.8 in the old notation is £5.13 in decimal pounds (actu-
ally £5.1333333). Write a program to convert the old pounds-shillings-pence format to
decimal pounds. 
In most compilers you can use the decimal number 156 (hex character constant ‘\x9c’)
to represent the pound sign (£). In some compilers, you can put the pound sign into your
program directly by pasting it from the Windows Character Map accessory.*/
